# [spindance.imp-smartthings.bridge](https://github.com/spindance/spindance.imp-smartthings.bridge)

This project is setup as an example for how to integrate web services from [Electric Imp](https://electricimp.com/) and [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com/).  

## Requirements
Before you can make use of this project, you will need a developer login for both Electric Imp, and Smart Things.  Both resources are free, though you may need valid hardware. (SmartThings Hub and Electric Imp001)

## Contents
This project consists of 2 parts: Electric Imp, and Smart Things, in their respective folders.  
Both systems are online IDE's.  To load the files in to the IDE's, they will need to be copied and pasted in to their respective device types and windows.
Both Directories also include a file: swagger.json.  That file can be loaded in to a swagger api documentation engine to give a better idea of what web services are involved in the calls.  If you can supply the client_id and client_secret, you can even make those calls from swagger, or it can auto-generate code to make those calls in the language of your choice.

## Running
To run this code, create a new SmartApp on SmartThings, and paste SmartApp.groovy in to the SmartApp window, then create a new application in Electric Imp and paste Agent.nut (from the Electric Imp folder) in to the agent window within Electric Imp's IDE. There are more steps that need to be done, but they are well documented in the article (article.md or on momentium.spindance.com) so check there.
